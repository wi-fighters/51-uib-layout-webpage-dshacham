                <p>I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. Even after I
                    switched into
                    psychology and cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis upon logic and
                    mechanism. It took a long
                    time for me to realize that my understanding of human behavior was relevant to my in- terest in the
                    design of
                    technology. As I watched people struggle with technology, it became clear that the difficulties were
                    caused by the
                    technology, not the people.</p>
                <p>I was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island (the
                    island name comes
                    from the fact that it is located on a river, three miles south of Middle- town in the state of
                    Pennsylvania). In this
                    incident, a rather simple mechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of
                    difficulties and confusion,
                    total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a severe radiation release, all of which
                    brought the American
                    nuclear power industry to a complete halt. The op- erators were blamed for these failures: “human
                    error” was the im-
                    mediate analysis. But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so
                    poorly designed that
                    error was inevi- table: design was at fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: we were
                    designing things for
                    people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many
                    engineers: machines
                    are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup,
                    that’s how I used to
                    think.</p>
