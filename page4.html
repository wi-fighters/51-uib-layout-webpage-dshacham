            <p>Machines have no leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed by a machine are known only
                by the
                machine and its
                designers.</p>
            <p>When people fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the machine does the wrong thing, its
                operators are blamed
                for not understanding the machine, for not following its rigid specifica- tions. With everyday
                objects, the result is
                frustration. With complex devices and commercial and industrial processes, the resulting
                difficulties can lead to
                accidents, injuries, and even deaths. It is time to reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon
                the machines and their
                design. It is the machine and its design that are at fault. It is the duty of machines and those who
                design them to
                understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

            <p>The reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction are numerous. Some come from the
                limitations of today’s
                technol- ogy. Some come from self-imposed restrictions by the designers, often to hold down cost.
                But most of the
                problems come from a complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective
                human-machine
                interaction. Why this deficiency? Be- cause much of the design is done by engineers who are experts
                in technology but
                limited in their understanding of people. “We are people ourselves,” they think, “so we understand
                people.” But in fact,
                we humans are amazingly complex. Those who have not studied human behavior often think it is pretty
                simple. Engineers,
                moreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is sufficient: “If only people would
                read the
                instructions,” they say, “everything would be all right.”
                Engineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to believe that all people must
                think this way, and
                they design their machines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers are upset, but often
                for the wrong
                reason. “What are these people doing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The prob- lem
                with the designs of
                most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the
                way we would wish
                it to be.</p>
