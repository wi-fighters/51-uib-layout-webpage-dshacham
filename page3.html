                <p>Faced with a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply mem- orize one or two fixed
                    settings
                    to
                    approximate what is
                    desired.</p>
                <p>In England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer- dryer combination, with super-duper
                    multisymbol controls,
                    all to do everything anyone could imagine doing with the washing and drying of clothes. The husband
                    (an engineering
                    psychologist) said he refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had simply memorized
                    one setting and tried
                    to ignore the rest. I asked to see the manual: it was just as confusing as the device. The whole
                    pur- pose of the design
                    is lost.</p>

                <h2>The Complexity of Modern Devices</h2>

                <p>All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of fur- niture in a room, the paths
                    through
                    a garden or
                    forest, or the in- tricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to decide
                    upon
                    the layout,
                    operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures,
                    rules and
                    procedures, and the organizational structures of busi- nesses and governments do not have physical
                    mechanisms, but their
                    rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, sometimes precisely recorded and
                    specified.</p>
                <p>But even though people have designed things since prehistoric times, the field of design is
                    relatively
                    new, divided into
                    many areas of specialty. Because everything is designed, the number of areas is enormous, ranging
                    from
                    clothes and
                    furniture to complex control rooms and bridges. This book covers everyday things, focusing on the
                    interplay between
                    technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill human needs while being
                    understand-
                    able and usable.
                    In the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not
                    only
                    must the re-
                    quirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be sat- isfied, but attention must be paid
                    to
                    the entire
                    experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction. The major areas of
                    design
                    relevant to
                    this book are industrial design, interaction design, and experience design. None of the fields is
                    well
                    defined, but the
                    focus of the efforts does vary, with industrial

                    designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and
                    usability, and
                    experience de- signers emphasizing the emotional impact. Thus:</p>

                <p>Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications
                    that
                    optimize the
                    function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and
                    manufacturer (from the
                    Industrial Design Society of America’s website).</p>

                <p>Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with tech- nology. The goal is to enhance
                    people’s
                    understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de-
                    sign
                    draws upon
                    principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.</p>

                <p>Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, ser- vices, events, and
                    environments
                    with a focus
                    placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.</p>

                <p>Design is concerned with how things work, how they are con- trolled, and the nature of the
                    interaction
                    between people
                    and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly,
                    the
                    products are
                    unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable, but force us to
                    behave
                    the way the
                    product wishes rather than as we wish.
                    Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards,
                    machines
                    are pretty
                    limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in
                    common
                    with one another,
                    experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared understanding. Instead,
                    machines usually
                    follow rather simple, rigid rules of be- havior. If we get the rules wrong even slightly, the
                    machine
                    does what it is
                    told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and creative, filled with
                    common
                    sense; that is, a
                    lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. But instead of capitalizing on these
                    strengths, machines
                    require us to be precise and accurate, things we are not very good at.</p>
