            <p>The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs, certainly
                without any
                need for trial
                and error.</p>
            <p>A friend told me of the time he got trapped in the doorway of a post office in a European
                city. The
                entrance was an
                imposing row of six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second, identical row. That’s a
                standard design: it
                helps reduce the airflow and thus maintain the indoor temperature of the building. There was no
                visible
                hardware:
                obviously the doors could swing in ei- ther direction: all a person had to do was push the side of
                the
                door and enter.
                My friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward, and he entered the building. Then,
                before
                he could get to
                the next row of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant. He didn’t realize it at
                the
                time, but he had
                moved slightly to the right. So when he came to the next door and pushed it, nothing happened.
                “Hmm,” he
                thought, “must
                be locked.” So he pushed the side of the adjacent door. Nothing. Puzzled, my friend decided to go
                outside again. He
                turned around and pushed against the side of a door. Nothing. He pushed the adjacent door. Nothing.
                The
                door he had just
                entered no longer worked. He turned around once more and tried the inside doors again. Nothing.
                Concern,
                then mild
                panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on the other side of the entranceway (to my
                friend’s
                right) passed
                eas- ily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried over to follow their path.</p>

            <p>How could such a thing happen? A swinging door has two sides. One contains the supporting
                pillar and the
                hinge, the
                other is un- supported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsup- ported edge. If you
                push
                on the hinge
                side, nothing happens. In my friend’s case, he was in a building where the designer aimed for
                beauty,
                not utility. No
                distracting lines, no visible pillars, no vis- ible hinges. So how can the ordinary user know which
                side
                to push on?
                While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible) supporting pillar, so he was pushing
                the
                doors on the
                hinged side. No wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably won a design prize.</p>
            <p>Two of the most important characteristics of good design are dis- coverability and
                understanding.
                Discoverability: Is it
                possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to per- form them?
                Understanding: What does it
                all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings
                mean?
                The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverabil- ity fails. Whether the device is a
                door or a stove, a
                mobile phone or a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible, and they must
                communicate the correct
                message: What actions are possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors that push, the
                designer must provide
                signals that naturally indi- cate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a
                vertical
                plate on the side
                to be pushed. Or make the supporting pillars visible. The vertical plate and supporting pillars are
                natural signals,
                naturally interpreted, making it easy to know just what to do: no labels needed.</p>
            <p>With complex devices, discoverability and understanding re- quire the aid of manuals or
                personal
                instruction. We accept
                this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things. Many products
                defy
                understanding
                simply because they have too many functions and controls. I don’t think that sim- ple home
                appliances—stoves, washing
                machines, audio and tele- vision sets—should look like Hollywood’s idea of a spaceship control room.
                They already do,
                much to our consternation.</p>
